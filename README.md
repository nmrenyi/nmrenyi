### Hi, I'm Yi REN (任一) 👋

I'm a nature-loving guy and a PhD candidate in THUIR. I grew up watching the soft white clouds wandering around the blue sky in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. I love beautiful things, like a meteor across the night sky🌠, warm streetlight around the corner🍁, the eyes of beloved girl❤️, etc.

My research interest includes recommendation system, information retrieval, deep learning, machine learning and **ALL THAT CAN BENEFIT HUMAN RACE, especially our next generation, our children.**

I love eating hotpot with mutton (in Chinese called 涮羊肉, one of the amazing food from my sweet hometown, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). In my spare time, I love reading, exploring new techs, photography, cooking, riding, running. In one word, I'm willing to **LIVE MY LIFE TO THE FULLEST**!

Feel free to contact me by renyi1006 AT gmail.com. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration. After all, besides research and technology, there stands a more colourful world for us to **EXPLORE**!
