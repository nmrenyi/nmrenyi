### Hi, I'm Yi REN (ä»»ä¸€). Welcome to my GitHub!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Student in THUIR, Tsinghua University.

I grew up watching soft white clouds wandering around the blue sky, lying on the warm grassland in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China.

My research interest includes **recommendation system**, information retrieval, deep learning, machine learning and **ALL THAT CAN BENEFIT HUMAN RACE, especially our next generation.**

Feel free to contact me by [renyi1006@gmail.com](mailto:renyi1006@gmail.com). I'm always open to conversations and collaboration.

I always believe, including research and technology, there stands a colourful world for us to **EXPLORE** and to **CREATE**!
